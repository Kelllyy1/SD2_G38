For the data simulator we needed:
✅ Power equation
✅ Number of BESS modules
✅ COM Ports

Number of BESS gets started by generating the cells
Once all cells generated
Weather simulation is run to calculate the power
Power conversion to voltage used then distributed among the cells
Faults and behaviors simulated
Data packaged into JSON
Sent over COM ports
